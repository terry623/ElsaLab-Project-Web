            DVSNet consists of three major steps:
            <br />
            DVSNet divides input frames into frame regions.
            <br />A Decision network (DN) analyzes the frame region pairs
            between the key and current frames, and evaluates a metric called
            the expected confidence score. According to the results, DVSNet
            selects a spatial warping path if the expected confidence score is
            larger than a pre-defined threshold, or a segmentation path
            otherwise.
            <br />
            Frame regions are forwarded to different paths to generate their
            regional semantic segmentations based on the decisions of DN. For
            the spatial warping path, a special warping function W is employed
            to process the the output of the flow network with the segmentation
            from the same region of the key frame.
